# CorgBot Example Repo
My girlfriend was interested in Ruby development, putting up a tutorial for her to break down as desired.


## Steps
``` bash
# Install Sinatra
gem install sinatra

# Run development server
rackup
```

## How It Works
On each index (`/`) load, selects a random image from the `public/images` directory and returns a view (`views/index.erb`) that displays the image. Run with it as you will.


## License
None, do what you want with it. Simply an example.
